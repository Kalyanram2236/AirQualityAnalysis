**Air Quality Analysis**

This project involves analyzing air quality data and visualizing various insights, including the seasonal air quality index (AQI), pollutant correlations, and AQI trends over time. The analysis is performed using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

** Requirements**

To run this analysis, you need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- `matplotlib`: For creating visualizations.
- `seaborn`: For enhanced visualizations and correlation heatmaps.

You can install the necessary libraries by running:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Dataset
This project uses an air quality dataset in CSV format (Air Quality data.csv). The dataset includes columns such as pollutant levels (e.g., PM2.5, NO2, NH3), air quality index (AQI) values, and the date of the record. The dataset is cleaned and analyzed for different insights related to air quality.

Steps in the Analysis
1. Data Preprocessing
Load the dataset from a CSV file.
Convert numeric columns stored as strings to numeric values (for pollutants).
Convert the Date of the record column to datetime format.
Handle missing values by dropping rows with missing dates.
Create new columns for temporal analysis: Year, Month, and Season.
2. Seasonal AQI Analysis
Group the data by city and season, then calculate the average AQI for each group.
Visualize the seasonal AQI using a bar chart.
3. Correlation Analysis
Compute the correlation matrix between pollutants and AQI values.
Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap.
4. AQI Trends Over Time
Visualize AQI trends over time using a line plot, grouped by city.
How to Run the Code
1. Data Loading
Ensure that the air quality dataset (Air Quality data.csv) is available in your working directory or update the file path in the code:

python
Copy code
file_path = '/content/Air Quality data.csv'  # Adjust this path if necessary
2. Preprocessing
The dataset is cleaned by converting necessary columns to the appropriate formats and handling missing values. It also adds columns for temporal analysis (Year, Month, Season).

3. Seasonal AQI Analysis
The code groups the dataset by Name of the city and Season, and calculates the average AQI for each group. The results are visualized in a bar chart.

4. Correlation Analysis
The correlation between pollutants (such as PM2.5, NO2, NH3) and the AQI is computed and visualized using a heatmap.

5. AQI Trends
The code also visualizes AQI trends over time for each city with a line chart.

Example Output
Seasonal AQI Bar Chart: Displays the average AQI for each season and city.

Correlation Heatmap: Shows the relationship between various pollutants and AQI values.

AQI Trends Line Chart: Illustrates how AQI values change over time for each city.

Future Enhancements
Integrate machine learning models to predict AQI based on pollutant levels.
Include more cities and regions in the dataset for broader analysis.
Implement interactive visualizations for user engagement.

 How to Customize

- If you want to further customize the analysis, you can update the `numeric_cols` and `pollutant_cols` lists to include other pollutant columns from the dataset.
- The `file_path` should be adjusted if the dataset is stored elsewhere, either locally or on cloud storage.
